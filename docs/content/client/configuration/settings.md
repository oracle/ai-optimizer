Those settings can then be loaded in later to return the {{< short_app_ref >}} to your previous configuration.  The settings an also be imported into another instance of the {{< short_app_ref >}}.

By default, these settings will not be exported and will have to be re-entered after uploading the settings in a new instance of the {{< short_app_ref >}}.
