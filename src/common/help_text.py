        Maximum number of tokens (words, sub-words, or characters) the model can consider
        at once when generating a response.   It defines how much prior conversation or text
        the model "remembers" within a single interaction.
        Value often determined from the model card.
        """,
    "temperature": """
        Controls how creative the responses are.
        A higher temperature results in more creative and varied answers, while a lower
        temperature produces more focused and predictable ones.  It is generally
        recommended altering this or Top P but not both.
        Default value often determined from the model card.

        Sets the maximum length of the response.
        The higher the number, the longer the potential response, but it won't exceed this
        limit.  Max value often determined from the model card.

        Limits the choice of words to the most likely ones.
        Setting a lower Top P uses only the most probable words, creating safer and more
        straightforward responses.  Higher Top P allows for more diverse and creative
        word choices in the response.  It is generally recommended altering this or

    "frequency_penalty": """
        Discourages repeating the same words or phrases in the response.
        A higher frequency penalty makes repetition less likely, promoting more varied
        language in the response.  Default value often determined from the model card.
        """,
    "presence_penalty": """
        Encourages the introduction of new topics or ideas in the response.
        A higher presence penalty makes bringing up new subjects more likely rather than

        The number of retrieved documents or passages that are used to enhance the generation
        of text.  For example, if set to 3, 3 of the most relevant documents based on the input

        The number of documents initially fetched from the knowledge base before any
        further filtering (e.g., Top K) or re-ranking is done. Fetching more documents
        (higher Fetch K) increases the initial computational load but provides more
        material to ensure the most relevant information is considered in the final step.

        A higher degree of diversity ensures that the documents cover a wider range of
